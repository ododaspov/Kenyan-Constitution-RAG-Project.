# 📚 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LangChain, FAISS & Groq

This project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline** using [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/), [FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss), [HuggingFace Embeddings](https://huggingface.co/), and [Groq LLMs](https://groq.com/).  

It allows you to upload a PDF, index its contents, and query it in natural language.
